This is my attempt to create simple GUI library for Linux, without any external dependencies. Based on the Xlib sources and https://github.com/abainbridge/x11_socket. Not working yet. 

Building:
-  copy main, micro_GUI.c, micro_GUI.h and build.py into your project;
-  compile with "gcc main.c micro_GUI.c -o main" or "python3 build.py"
-  run main with "./main"
